## BEFORE RUNNING THESE SCRIPTS

You must create a folder at the path ./applications/.
This folder must contain all the .desktop files of the apps used by your users.
The Application class will match the desktopid given to it to an exact name in
that folder. If you have an app with multiple binaries (e.g. app and appd) and
you want all those binaries to be recognised as the same app by this code, you
must create a symbolic link from app.desktop (the "main" desktop for the app)
to appd.desktop (the name of the additional binary for it).

The script find-wrong-symlink.sh can then be run to ensure that all symbolic
links have absolute paths and will be properly interpreted regardless of the
working directory from which this code is run.


You must create a folder at the path ../data/. This folder must contain a child
called current/ which either contains or links to the data to be analysed. It
is assumed that ../data/current/ will have a "data" subfolder with all the .log
files created by PreloadLogger and the activity.sqlite file created by the
Zeitgeist infrastructure. Thus, the paths:
 ../data/current/data/activity.sqlite
 ../data/current/data/*.log
Are assumed to exist. Note you will manually have to extract the .log.gz files
made by PreloadLogger into .log files, using gunzip.
